# Hello

## So, What is Git? 

Git is a Source Control \(sometimes it is also called Version Control\). So, what is Source control?  Source control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Source control is specifically for source code, Version control is versioning everything not just source code like  images, documents, binary data etc. For better deeper understanding check this [BitBucket tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control).

Another explaination from [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/source-control/git/)  "Git is an open-source distributed source code management system. Git allows you to create a copy of your repository known as a branch. Using this branch, you can then work on your code independently from the stable version of your codebase. Once you are ready with your changes, you can store them as a set of differences, known as a commit. You can pull in commits from other contributors to your repository, push your commits to others, and merge your commits back into the main version of the repository".
